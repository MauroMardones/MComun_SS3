abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

@article{Bishop2006,
abstract = {Standardization of commercial catch and effort data is important in fisheries where standardized abundance indices based on fishery-dependent data are a fundamental input to stock assessments. The goal of the standardization is then to minimize bias due to the confounding of apparent abundance patterns with fishing power. There is a high risk of confounding between fishing power and abundance in fisheries where the fleet has altered their fishing technology over the years. Also, the spatial aspects and the fishing history can be so heterogeneous that any standardization really involves an extrapolation, for example to a hypothetical standard vessel. When the standardization involves an extrapolation, then the appropriate modeling strategy is to build a so-called estimation model, rather than a predictive model. Strategies to build such an estimation model from fishery-dependent data include: pay careful attention to subject matter, and collect information about potential confounding effects to include in the model (putting a high value on the acquisition of data on covariates); model variable catchability at a highly disaggregated scale; aim for realistic coefficients when fitting the model and pay relatively less attention to achieving precision or maximizing explained variance; adopt modern statistical methods to combine data from different sources; and if data are deficient, then apply precautionary allowances. These strategies offer some protection against bias due to confounding, in the absence of formal criteria for identifying the best model. {\textcopyright} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2006.},

Automatic Differentiation Model Builder (ADMB) is a programming framework based on automatic differentiation, aimed at highly nonlinear models with a large number of parameters. The benefits of using AD are computational efficiency and high numerical accuracy, both crucial in many practical problems. We describe the basic components and the underlying philosophy of ADMB, with an emphasis on functionality found in no other statistical software. One example of such a feature is the generic implementation of Laplace approximation of high-dimensional integrals for use in latent variable models. We also review the literature in which ADMB has been used, and discuss future development of ADMB as an open source project. Overall, the main advantages of ADMB are flexibility, speed, precision, stability and built-in methods to quantify uncertainty. {\textcopyright} 2012 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

However, there is no consensus amongst practitioners as to the best approach to data weighting. From a discussion of some key questions concerning data weighting in stock assessment models, I draw three guiding principles: (i) do not let other data stop the model from fitting abundance data well; (ii) when weighting age or length composition data, allow for correlations; and (iii) do not down-weight abundance data because they may be unrepresentative. I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles. Two factors that complicate this approach are that some decisions are inevitably subjective (which underlines the need for expert knowledge in stock assessment), and some technical problems are unresolved.},

abstract = {'Risk' has appeared more frequently in the fisheries management literature in recent years. The reasons for this are partly internal (scientists seeking better ways to advise fishery managers) and partly external (e.g., adoption of the precautionary approach). Though terminology varies, there is consensus that there are two stages in dealing with risk. The first (here called risk assessment) is the formulation of advice for fisheries managers in a way that conveys the possible consequences of uncertainty. This advice is in the form of an evaluation of the expected effects of alternative management options, rather than recommendations. Risk assessment has been undertaken in many fisheries, and there is general agreement as to how it should be done (although technical details differ). The second stage (risk management) is the way fishery managers take uncertainty into account in making decisions. Much fisheries risk management is informal, i.e., nonquantitative, undocumented, and loosely linked (if at all) with a risk assessment. The major reason for this is that the objectives of fisheries management are often conflicting and are rarely stated in a way that provides explicit direction to managers or scientists.},

abstract = {We compiled 297 series of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and independent abundance data (as estimated by research trawl surveys) and used observation error and random effects models to test the hypothesis that CPUE is pro- portional to true abundance. We used a power curve, for which we were interested in the shape parameter (b). There was little difference among species, ages, or gear types in the distributions of the raw estimates of b for each CPUE series. We examined three groups: cod, flatfish, and gadiformes, finding strong evidence that CPUE was most likely to remain high while abundance declines (i.e., hyperstability, where b {\textless} 1). The range in the mean of the random effects distribution for b was quite small, 0.64–0.75. Cod showed the least hyperstability, but still, 76{\%} of the mass of the ran- dom effects distribution was below 1. Based on simulations, our estimates of b are positively biased by approximately 10{\%}; this should be considered in the application of our findings here. We also considered the precision of CPUE indi- ces through a meta-analysis of observation error variances. The most precise indices were those from flatfish (median coefficient of variation of »0.42). R{\'{e}}sum{\'{e}}},

abstract = {Fisheries management depends on reliable quantification of uncertainty for decision-making. We evaluate which uncertainty method can be expected to perform best for fisheries stock assessment. The method should generate confidence intervals that are neither too narrow nor too wide, in order to cover the true value of estimated quantities with a probability matching the claimed confidence level. This simulation study compares the performance of the delta method, the bootstrap, and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC). A statistical catch-at-age model is fitted to 1000 simulated datasets, with varying recruitment and observation noise. Six reference points are estimated, and confidence intervals are constructed across a range of significance levels. Overall, the delta method and MCMC performed considerably better than the bootstrap, and MCMC was the most reliable method in terms of worst-case performance, for our relatively data-rich scenario and catch-at-age model, which was not subject to substantial model misspecification. All three methods generated too narrow confidence intervals, underestimating the true uncertainty. Bias correction improved the bootstrap performance, but not enough to match the performance of the delta method and MCMC. We recommend using MCMC as the default method for quantifying uncertainty in fisheries stock assessment, although the delta method is the fastest to apply, and the bootstrap is useful to diagnose estimator bias. {\textcopyright} 2012 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {The relationship between the biomass of reproductively mature individuals (spawning stock) and the resulting offspring added to the population (recruitment), the stock-recruitment relationship, is a fundamental and challenging problem in all of population biology. The steepness of this relationship is commonly defined as the fraction of recruitment from an unfished population obtained when the spawning stock biomass is 20{\%} of its unfished level. Since its introduction about 20 years ago, steepness has become widely used in fishery management, where it is usually treated as a statistical quantity. Here, we investigate the reproductive ecology of steepness, using both unstructured and age-structured models. We show that if one has sufficient information to construct a density-independent population model (maximum per capita productivity and natural mortality for the unstructured case or maximum per capita productivity, natural mortality and schedules of size and maturity at age for the structured model) then one can construct a point estimate for steepness. Thus, steepness cannot be chosen arbitrarily. If one assumes that the survival of recruited individuals fluctuates within populations, it is possible, by considering the early life history, to construct a prior distribution for steepness from this same demographic information. We develop the ideas for both compensatory (Beverton-Holt) and over-compensatory (Ricker) stock-recruitment relationships. We illustrate our ideas with an example concerning bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus/orientalis, Scombridae). We show that assuming that steepness is unity when recruitment is considered to be environmentally driven is not biologically consistent, is inconsistent with a precautionary approach, and leads to the wrong scientific inference (which also applies for assigning steepness any other single value).

abstract = {Limited data, and the requirement to provide science-based advice for exploited populations, have led to the development of statistical methods that combine several sources of information into a single analysis. This approach, " integrated analysis" was first formulated by Fournier and Archibald in 1982. Contemporary use of integrated analysis involves using all available data, in as raw a form as appropriate, in a single analysis. Analyses that were traditionally carried out independently are now conducted simultaneously through likelihood functions that include multiple data sources. For example, the traditional analysis of converting catch-at-length data into catch-at-age data for use in an age-structured population dynamics models can be avoided by including the basic data used in this conversion, length-frequency and conditional age-at-length data, in the likelihood function. This allows for consistency in assumptions and permits the uncertainty associated with both data sources to be propagated to final model outputs, such as catch limits under harvest control rules. The development of the AD Model Builder software has greatly facilitated the use of integrated analyses, and there are now several general stock assessment models (e.g., Stock Synthesis) that allow many data types and model assumptions to be analyzed simultaneously. In this paper, we define integrated analysis, describe its history and development, give several examples, and describe the advantages of and problems with integrated analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

Today, it remains popular for its clarity, richness of content and direct relevance to agricultural, biological, health, engineering, and other applications. The authors focus on examining the way a response variable depends on a combination of explanatory variables, treatment, and classification variables. They give particular emphasis to the important case where the dependence occurs through some unknown, linear combination of the explanatory variables. The Second Edition includes topics added to the core of the first edition, including conditional and marginal likelihood methods, estimating equations, and models for dispersion effects and components of dispersion. The discussion of other topics-log-linear and related models, log odds-ratio regression models, multinomial response models, inverse linear and related models, quasi-likelihood functions, and model checking-was expanded and incorporates significant revisions. Comprehension of the material requires simply a knowledge of matrix theory and the basic ideas of probability theory, but for the most part, the book is self-contained. Therefore, with its worked examples, plentiful exercises, and topics of direct use to researchers in many disciplines, Generalized Linear Models serves as ideal text, self-study guide, and reference.},

abstract = {Stock synthesis (SS) is a statistical age-structured population modeling framework that has been applied in a wide variety of fish assessments globally. The framework is highly scalable from data-weak situations where it operates as an age-structured production model, to complex situations where it can flexibly incorporate multiple data sources and account for biological and environmental processes. SS implements compensatory population dynamics through use of a function relating mean recruitment to spawner reproductive output. This function enhances the ability of SS to operate in data-weak situations and enables it to estimate fishery management quantities such as fishing rates that would provide for maximum sustainable yield and to employ these rates in forecasts of potential yield and future stock status. Complex model configurations such as multiple areas and multiple growth morphs are possible, tag-recapture data can be used to aid estimation of movement rates among areas, and most parameters can change over time in response to environmental and ecosystem factors. SS is coded using Auto-Differentiation Model Builder, so inherits its powerful capability to efficiently estimate hundreds of parameters using either maximum likelihood or Bayesian inference. Output processing, principally through a package developed in R, enables rapid model diagnosis. Details of the underlying population dynamics and the statistical framework used within SS are provided. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

This paper proposes an approach to determine fishing tactics from the analysis of commercial catch and effort data. The ap- proach is based on typologies of fishing operations involving multivariate descriptive methods like factorial analyses and classification techniques. The obtained types of fishing operations are considered as fishing tactics. The approach is applied to two contrasting examples, a small-scale Senegalese fishery and a Celtic Sea fishery that operates at a larger scale. Catch per species and fishing effort are computed per tactic. Results emphasize the importance of fishing loca- tion and seasonal effects for characterizing fishing tactics.},

We use a logistic regression of multispecies presence-absence information to predict the probability that the target species would be present. A critical value of probability that best predicts target species presence and absence in the data set forms an objective basis for subsetting the trip records.

abstract = {Steepness (h) is a fundamental metric in population dynamics because it defines the relationship between parental stock and offspring. h represents a direct measurement of resilience and is therefore crucial in the management of harvested populations. However, h represents one of the most difficult parameters to estimate, even for data-rich stocks. It is usually estimated using indirect methods based on meta-analysis. Existing meta-analyses use all available estimates of h from different sources of information (i.e., from outside or within the stock assessment model) and report non-significant relationships between h and other life history traits, even though several theoretical analyses suggest the contrary. We conducted a two-stage meta-analysis, firstly selecting suitable h estimates from stock assessment models for fish stocks worldwide. 42 estimates of h were collected and several life history attributes were used as explanatory variables within generalised linear models (GLMs). We found a significant relationship (p {\textless} 0.05) between h and the ratio between length at 50{\%} maturity (L50) and asymptotic length (L∞). The second stage of our meta-analysis was to apply this relationship to 19 fish stocks harvested off Chile to estimate species-specific h and the associated uncertainty. We discuss the assumptions of the proposed meta-analysis, the reliability of the estimated uncertainties and outline the potential application in the assessment and management of fish resources in Chile.},

abstract = {Abundance indices are difficult to derive from multispecies catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) data as these critically rely on the ability to account for targeting behaviour that directs effort towards a particular target species or species-complex. We developed a novel standardization method that uses continuous principal component scores, derived from a Principal Component Analysis of the catch composition data, as non-linear predictor variables for targeted effort within a Generalized Additive Model (GAM) framework. This 'Direct Principal Component' method (DPC) is compared to a commonly used standardization approach, in which clusters of fishing tactics are identified from the catch composition and treated as categorical variables. We employed GAMs, which incorporate spatial, seasonal, and fishing power effects, to evaluate the statistical performance of the two alternative sets of covariates. The GAMs were applied to CPUE datasets from the South African hand-line fishery, covering three fishing regions over a period of 26 years, to provide abundance indices for two commercially important species, carpenter, Argyrozona argyrozona and silver kob, Argyrosomus inodorus. Results show that both approaches removed substantial variation from the CPUE data, but that the DPC approach was statistically superior as judged by the AIC, deviance explained and results from 10-fold bootstrap cross-validations. The DPC method represents a more direct approach, is less time-consuming and subjective and therefore considerably easier to implement. We present evidence that the DPC was able to account for substantial shifts in targeting without masking the year effect. The standardized CPUE time series showed positive responses for both species as total landings decreased due to forced effort reductions in 2000. The approach presented here has potentially unlocked useful information for stock assessment in the over two million individual catch records available for the South African hand-line fishery and similar multispecies fisheries. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},
